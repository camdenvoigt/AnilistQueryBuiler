# AnilistQueryBuilder

This is a gem to help write queries for Anlists API 2.0 (https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/).
Instead of writing queries inside of long string that can be hard to read AnlistQueryBuilder will allow queries to
be created directly in code. This code also looks similar to actual GraphQL syntax and therefore will be easy to translate and lead to less errors.
